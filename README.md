# React + Vite

# AgileKart

🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

This project is currently under development. It uses **React + Vite** with HMR and ESLint rules as a minimal setup.  
The goal is to evolve AgileKart into a recruiter‑ready e‑commerce demo showcasing modern UI, responsive layouts, and product catalog features.

## Current Setup

- Vite + React starter template
- ESLint rules for code quality
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled
- Two official plugins available:
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) (Babel/oxc)
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) (SWC)

## React Compiler

Not enabled yet due to performance considerations.  
See [React Compiler docs](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation) if you want to experiment.

## Roadmap

- ✅ Initial Vite + React setup
- ✅ ESLint integration
- 🚧 Hero slider and banner section
- 🚧 Product catalog
- 🚧 Checkout flow
- 🚧 Deployment and polish

## Notes

This repository is **unfinished** and actively being developed. Expect frequent commits, incomplete features, and experimental code.
